## Character Creation Outline
##### Updated: XX
### Step 1: Concept
- Every character starts with a concept. Ours are heroic mortals by the standards of Azeroth. We should all have a good grasp of our characters. A small sentence or two is enough for now.
  - ***Example**: A smuggler turned hero fighting against the Scarlet Crusade, or a savvy diplomat working to further the schemes of their organization.*.
- Once you have your concept you proceed to pick an **Exalt type** and (if applicable) **Caste** or **Aspect**. This is a fully out of character choice, pick the type best suited to your character and note it on the character sheet along with the **Anima Effects**.

`Volteal is an expert martial artist, Cleric of Elune, and skilled diplomat. He fits most as a Solar Exalt of the Zenith Caste.`

### Step 2: Attributes
Your character likely has a preferred approach to problems. Tge three Attributes: Force, Finesse, and Fortitude, represent those approaches. On the [Reference Sheet](/LINK/) you will find each Attribute described in detail, but in a nutshell: 
- Your character uses **Force** to power through a problem with physical prowess or hard logic
- Your character uses **Finesse** when they use quickness or cleverness
- Or your character uses **Fortitude** if they endure until it’s over.

Take a moment to picture your character under duress, backed into a corner, or standing up to fight for what’s right. What do they do? Your answer should be which of these three Attributes is their highest.

Once you know which is the highest Assign  it a total of 4 dots. Assign your second highest (your character's supporting attribute) a total of 3 dot, and finally assign your lowest attribute 2 dots. A rating of five is the pinnacle of mortal achievement, two is about average for a mortal, and one is just not very good.

`Eras'tien Volteal likes to solve his probelms with finnesse and when needed force, but he very tenacious. Volteal gets Force 3, Finesse 4, and Fortitude 2.`

### Step 3: Abilities
- Assign one 5, one 4, three 3s, two 2s and one 1 to your character’s Abilities.

Every character comes with a skill set gained through training and dedication. One character is an excellent hand-to-hand fighter, another runs like the wind, and a third has an unshakable will. Fourteen Abilities represent these skills: Athletics, Awareness, Close Combat, Craft, Embassy, Integrity, Navigate, Performance, Physique, Presence, Ranged Combat, Sagacity, Stealth, and War. Each has a rating of one dot (beginner) to five dots (exemplar). Chapter Four, p. 121, explains Abilities in detail.

Assign one ability 5 dots , one ability 4 dots, three abilities 3 dots, two abilities 2 dots, and one ability 1 dot to your character.

The five-dot rated Ability is what your character does best, maybe even what they’re already famous for. That is up to you. At the other end of the range, the one-dot rating represents an Ability your character isn’t very good at yet or has just picked up. You probably noticed that a spread of eight leaves you with six Abilities at 0 dots. That’s okay — those are skills with which your character has no real experience.

`A diplomat must above all things be able to nagivate social situations and the bureaucracy of state. He must also be able to defend himsels when needed. He has some minor military experience, and is an acomplshed martial artist. Volteal gets the following ability spread: EMbassy 5, Close Combat 4, Awareness 3, Integrity 3, Presence 1, Athletics 2, War 3. `

### Step 4: Charms
So far we have done raw stats. It is time to add a more active ingredient. Charms are an expression of your character's skill or supernatiral abilities, they are what make the combat (physical and Social) interesting. You start the game with one **Excellency** and **five other Charms** of your choice for a total of **six (6)**. (Spells, Evocations, and Martial Arts Charms count as one Charm each). If you choose a **Circle of Sorcery** (magic) as a Charm, you can also select spells. You get **one free spell** to go with the circle. Every spell on top of that counts as a Charm. The same one-for-one replacement holds for martial arts Charms.

Some Charms have **prerequisites** you must meet before you can take them. Feel free to go back to steps one and two and rearrange your stats if there’s a Charm you really want but currently don’t have the right dots for.

`Volteal chooses an Embassy Excelleny to suplement his diplomacy with Chi. Then he takes 3 Martial Arts charms: White Reaper Form, Bleeding Crescent Strike, and Flickering Corona Barrier. He then invests into 1 Integrity charm and 1 War charm: Loyal Guardian Approach, Fearless Vanguard Technique, finally he is going get an evocation from Step 5 below.`

### Step 5: Merits
Characters in this version of the system get 4 merrits. You get as one primary,  one as secondary, and two as tertiary. Everyone also gets Artifact (Secondary) as a bonus merit to account for having at least some magical equipment. **You only get one** these are extremely powerful and it will be your primary magic item. Lesser ones do not require a merrit. 

`Volteal is a social character and his defininf merit is that he has influence with organizations, contacts, and resources as such he takes the following merrits: Influence (Primary), Contacts (Secondary), Resources (Tertiary), Familiar (Tertiary), and finally he takes a Scythe as his Artifact Weapon to complement his martial art.`

### Step 6: Finishing Touches
This section is easy simply follow the steps bellow and fill them in.
- **Essence** 1, and 6 motes
- **Health levels**: two 0, two −1s, two −2s, and Incapacitated, plus any bonuses from Ox Body.
- **Defenses**
  - **Parry** equals Attribute + Close Combat divided by two (round up)
  - **Evasion** equals Attribute + Athletics divided by two (round up)
	- You use whichever is higher
  - **Soak** is 1, + 1 if your Physique is 3 or higher, then add any armor soak value.
  - Hardness is equal to Essence + 2, plus any from armor.
  - Resolve is 2, +1 if you have Integrity 1, +2 if you have Integrity 3 or higher.
- Add any mundane equipment that fits your concept, any artifacts gained from Merits, and any benefits from hearthstones if you took one.
